NLP Power workshop will be held in a hybrid format.
All plenary sessions will be held (either livestreamed or broadcasted) in Zoom and followed by a live Q&A (unless the schedule indicates otherwise). Questions can be asked in the Zoom chat during the presentations. 
Poster sessions will be held in Gather.town. 

**The links to the zoom session and Gather.town space can be found on the conference page of the workshop** (only accessible with conference registration).
