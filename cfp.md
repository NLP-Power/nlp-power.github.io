## Call for papers

The official second call for papers is available [here](https://github.com/NLP-Power/nlp-power.github.io/blob/main/cfp2.txt).

We accept three types of papers
1. Standard workshop papers: anonymized submissions describing substantially original research not previously published in other venues.
2. Extended abstracts: anonymized submissions describing preliminary but interesting ideas or results not previously published in other venues.
3. Cross-submissions: non-anonymized papers on relevant topics that have previously been accepted for publication in another venue.


## How to submit
We accept papers via **[ACL Rolling Review page](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/NLP-Power)**
Workshop papers cannot exceed 6 pages in length (excluding ethical considerations and references). The papers can have an optional appendix as described in ARR CFP guidelines. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into appendices. The reviewers are not required to consider the appendix during the review process.

We accept three types of papers
 - **Standard workshop papers:** anonymized submissions describing substantially original research not previously published in other venues.
 - **Extended abstracts:** anonymized submissions describing preliminary but interesting ideas or results not previously published in other venues.
 - **Cross-submissions:** non-anonymized papers on relevant topics that have previously been accepted for publication in another venue.

## Evaluation and decision criteria

Submissions will be reviewed in a double-blind manner and assessed based on
their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. 

## Dual submissions and preprints
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors should declare dual submissions if accepted. Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should inform the workshop organizers by April 15, thus their papers will be considered non-archival.

You are also allowed to submit an already published paper for presentation at the workshop. You must declare such papers as non-archival.
