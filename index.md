# NLP Power

The First Workshop on Efficient Benchmarking in NLP. The workshop programmewill be available [here](https://nlp-power.github.io/program.html).

## Important dates

 - TBA

## Workshop description

Benchmarks have played a crucial role in accelerating progress in the field of NLP, covering a widerange of research directions: 
natural language understanding  (Wang  et  al.,  2019a,b),  natural  language generation (Gehrmann et al., 2021), 
cross-lingual knowledge transfer (Hu et al., 2020), prob-ing and interpretation (Conneau and Kiela, 2018;Conneau  et  al.,  2018),  
ethical  biases  (Röttgeret al., 2020) and robustness to adversarial attacks(Morris  et  al.,  2020). 
Despite  that  the  concept of benchmarking has become a standard practicefor  evaluating  upcoming  models  against  
one  another  and  human  solvers,  there  is  still  a  number of unresolved issues and methodological concerns (Rogers, 2019; Dehghani et al., 2021).

- Applying analysis techniques from neuroscience to analyse high-dimensional vector representations (such as Haxby et al., 2001; Kriegeskorte, 2008) in artificial neural networks;
- Analyzing the network's response to strategically chosen inputs in order to infer the linguistic generalizations that the network has acquired (e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Hupkes et al., 2020);
- Examining the performance of the network on simplified or formal languages (e.g., Hupkes et al., 2018; Lake et al., 2018);
- Proposing modifications to neural network architectures that can make them more interpretable (e.g., Palanki et al., 2018);
- Scaling up neural network analysis techniques developed in the connectionist literature in the 1990s (Elman, 1991); 
- Testing whether interpretable information can be decoded from intermediate representations (e.g., Adi et al.,  2017; Chrupala et al., 2017; Hupkes et al., 2017, Conneau et al., 2018);
- Translating insights on neural networks interpretation from the vision domain (e.g., Zeiler & Fergus, 2014) to language;
- Explaining model predictions (e.g., Lei et al., 2016; Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2017): What are ways to explain specific decisions made by neural networks?
- Adversarial examples in NLP (e.g., Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Belinkov & Bisk, 2018): How to generate them and how to evaluate their quality?
- Open-source tools for analyzing neural networks in NLP (e.g., Strobelt et al., 2018; Rikters, 2018).
- Evaluation of analysis results: How do we know that the analysis is valid?
- Analysing the linguistic properties captured by contextualised word representations (e.g. Aina et al 2019, Bommasani et al., 2020)
- Analysing learning and inference mechanisms of neural networks, such as memory and attention (e.g. Abnar and Zuidema, 2020, Serrano and Smith, 2019, Haviv et al., 2019)

BlackboxNLP 2021 is the fourth BlackboxNLP workshop. 
The programme and proceedings of the previous editions, which were held at EMNLP 2018, ACL 2019 and EMNLP 2020, can be found [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2018/), [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2019/) and [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2020/).

The official call for papers is available [here](cfp.txt).

## Paper submission 

Papers and abstracts should follow the official __ 2022 style guidelines and should be submitted via ACL Rolling Review

Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).

## Dual submissions and preprints 
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper's main conference submission id.
The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated.
Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by September 20.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted
without any restrictions on when they were posted.

## Camera-ready information
Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use one extra page to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages.
