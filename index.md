# NLP Power

The First Workshop on Efficient Benchmarking in NLP. The workshop programmewill be available [here](https://nlp-power.github.io/program.html).

## Important dates

 - TBA

## Workshop description

Benchmarks have played a crucial role in accelerating progress in the field of NLP, covering a widerange of research directions: 
natural language understanding  (Wang  et  al.,  2019a,b),  natural  language generation (Gehrmann et al., 2021), cross-lingual knowledge transfer (Hu et al., 2020), prob-ing and interpretation (Conneau and Kiela, 2018;Conneau  et  al.,  2018),  ethical  biases  (Röttgeret al., 2020) and robustness to adversarial attacks (Morris  et  al.,  2020). Despite  that  the  concept of benchmarking has become a standard practicefor  evaluating  upcoming  models  against  one  another  and  human  solvers,  there  is  still  a  number of unresolved issues and methodological concerns (Rogers, 2019; Dehghani et al., 2021).

The main objectives of this workshop are: (1) encouraging the development of optimal model ranking and evaluation approaches for NLP benchmarks, (2) rethinking benchmarking strategies that best account for computational costs, energy and ethical considerations, out-of-domain language capabilities and meet the end user preferences. We welcome submissions on the ongoing and finished research and hope to provide an opportunity to present their work and exchange ideas. Particular topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Computational efficiency and energy considerations;
 - New practices in measuring linguistic competence in mono- and multilingual benchmarks;
 - Critical analysis of existing benchmark evaluation and construction designs;
 - Guidelines for reproducibility and reliability of the benchmark results;
 - Construction of zero-shot and few-shot mono- and multilingual benchmarks;
 - Novel approaches to benchmark evaluation considering task complexity, model architecture, number of parameters and result aggregation;
 - Applications of utility theory, voting theory and microeconomics  to benchmark evaluation;
 - User and application-specific model evaluation;
 - New metrics and tasks for computationally lean comparison between models and measuring interpretability;
 - Analysis of human and model evaluation strategies in natural language understanding, text generation, knowledge transfer;
 - Human evaluation protocols, specifically in the multilingual setting;
 - Tracing biases and ethical issues in benchmark datasets and models.



The official call for papers is available [here](cfp.txt).

## Paper submission 

Papers and abstracts should follow the official __ 2022 style guidelines and should be submitted via ACL Rolling Review

Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).

## Dual submissions and preprints 
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper's main conference submission id.
The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated.
Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by September 20.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted
without any restrictions on when they were posted.

## Camera-ready information
Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use one extra page to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages.

## Anti-Harassment Policy
NLP Power 2022 adheres to the [ACL Anti-Harassment Policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/sphp?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy).

## Demographic Diversity
The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to our workshop. First, we will make sure that the ACL Anti-Harassment Policy is respected during the organization and execution of the event. Second, our approach to the selection of invited speakers / PC takes into consideration the need for demographic diversity. Third, our organizing team includes individuals from diverse genders and sociodemographic backgrounds.
